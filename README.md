To my knowledge, there is currently no xpath 2.0 parser available for python.  
The idea of this fork of Greg Haskins' xpath 1.0 parser is to remedy that, at least to some extent.

This is a lazy endeavor--that is, I'm not committing to implementing a full parser.  
Rather, I'll start with specific xpath 2.0 xpaths, create tests for them, and see if I can get it to pass.  
The particular tests chosen are driven by commercial demands.
